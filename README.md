## Graph

### Tarjan's Algorithm

1. **Cycle Merging**:
   Merge cycles into a single vertex.
2. **Articulation Points**:
   Identify points in a graph which, when removed, cause the graph to split into two or more disconnected subgraphs.

3. **Bridges**:
   Identify edges in a graph which, when removed, cause the graph to split into two disconnected subgraphs.

4. **Biconnected Components (BCC)**:
   Find all biconnected components which do not contain any articulation points. Two BCCs can be separated by an articulation point or a bridge.

## String

### Manacher's Algorithm

Manacher's Algorithm is an efficient algorithm to find all sub-palindromes of a string in linear time \(O(N)\).
